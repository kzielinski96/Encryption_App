# Encryption_App
JavaFX application that decodes WAV file header and gets the spectrogram out of
its data chunk. The spectrogram logic was implemented with the help of the FFT
class created by Orlando Selenu. Applcation also alows user to encrypt and decrypt
the file. Encryption and decryption are based on the XOR operation performed on the
bytes from data chunk and key generated by RSA algorithm.
