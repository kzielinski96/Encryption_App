# Encryption_App
Very basic encryption app, extended on decrypting the WAV file 
header and getting its spectrogram from the file's data chunk. 
Spectrogram was implemented with help of the FFT class wrote by Orlando Selenu.
Later JavaFX components were added in order to give application a user 
inteface.
